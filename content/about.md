Hey there! I'm Kim Eik — husband, dad of three, part-time farmer, full-time nerd.

When I'm not fixing something on the farm, I'm probably breaking something on my computer… usually on purpose. Or the other way around — though in that case, definitely not on purpose.

I work as an IT consultant, which means I spend my days helping systems behave, and my nights trying to make new ones misbehave (for science, of course). Lately, I've been deep into Go — the language, not the board game — and the whole ecosystem around it. I love building things that are simple, fast, and clean, even if it means writing way too much automation for something I could've done manually in ten minutes.

Outside the tech bubble, I'm usually out on the farm — wrangling apple trees and keeping things running. It's a nice balance: one part nature, one part code, and just enough chaos to keep life interesting.

Welcome to my little corner of the internet — part code, part mud, and entirely me.

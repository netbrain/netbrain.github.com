So I came across this static [site generator](https://gohugo.io/) built using [Go](https://golang.org), and I just couldn't resist trying it. After a couple of hours of tweaking, customizing and banging my head on the wall, I had successfully created a proper blog and even imported a [blog entry](/post/a-simple-todo-application-tradition-vs-cqrs+es "a-simple-todo-application-tradition-vs-cqrs+es") I had written for [Bouvet](https://www.bouvet.no/en/ "bouvet"), my current employer, which in my opinion is a great place to work.

But anyway, don't expect much from this blog/site. I'm not really that active, at least I don't think I am. But if I happen to be in the mood and feel that I have something substantial to say then maybe I'll post a thing or two.

No promises though.
